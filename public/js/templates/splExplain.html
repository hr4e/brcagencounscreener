        <span class='explained'>Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations</span> –
        Gene mutations are found in about 1 out of every 20 women with breast cancer.
        The genes are called “BRCA1 and BRCA2.”  These mutations are also found in a small
        number of women who get ovarian cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we find these genes mutations before a woman develops cancer, we can recommend ways
        to lower her chances of getting breast an and / or ovarian cancer. Examples of these include
        lifestyle changes, medications and/or surgery.
    </p>
    <p>
        For women who have already had these cancers before being tested, BRCA test results
        help them choose measures to reduce chances of cancer coming back.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you haven’t been tested, this questionnaire can help you decide
        whether you might want to be.  Please keep in mind that testing isexpensive,
        imperfect and may have uncertain implications for your
        health.  We recommend genetic counseling before having these or any
        other genetic tests.

        <span class='explained'>Screening vs. diagnostic mammogram</span> – a screeing mammogram is done as part of
        periodic health screening ... and for no other reason.  A diagnostic mammograms is
        done to follow up a finding: typically either an abnormal screening mammogram or the
        evaluation of a breast lump.

    <p>
        <span class='explained'>Genetic female</span> – a woman by birth, has never had transgender surgery,
        and in whom there is no reason to assume a genetic abnormality that
        would affect her gender.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you HAVE had BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing and still have questions about
        what this means, please discuss with your care providers at your earliest
        convenience.
