        To more accurately assess your chances of getting breast breast and ovarian cancer, we need
        the details about the information you could not provide.  For details about any prior cancers
        (including prior breast cancer and its characteristics), please check with your care provider(s).
        To help you collect information from your family that would fill in any other missing details,
        please obtain a Family History form from the receptionist. We recommend that you talk with a
        <span data-bind='text: sponsorAbbrev'></span> genetic counseling professional,
        preferably after you have learned as much as you can from your family.
        But whether or not you can learn more, please make that appointment by calling:
        <span data-bind='text: sponsorContactPhone'></span>.  You also may ask the receptionist
        for our handout on this topic.

        If you have <b><i>already</i></b> had genetic testing and still have questions about
        what this means, please discuss with your care providers at your earliest
        convenience.
